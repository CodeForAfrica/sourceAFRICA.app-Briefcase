sourceAFRICA.app - Briefcase
----------------------------

Briefcase allows for organisations to have a self-branded website to present collections or sets of documents that are hosted on sourceAFRICA.

With Briefcase, civic watchdogs, such as the media or social justice NGOs, can ensure brand alignment in presentation of dossiers they have used in their reportage while leveraging sourceAFRICA's powerful backend.

To make it as easy as possible for organisations to get set up with their own 'Briefcase', we made it;

1. Lightweight: Having as few moving parts as possible, Briefcase can be hosted for free on Github pages, or cheaply on any web hosting.
2. Simple: With search being the main function, we removed any complexity to users exploring actual documents. This makes for a more streamlined user experience.
3. Customisable: Configuration and adaptability are at the heart of Briefcase. We've looked how to make it as easy as possible to make your own changes in a couple of minutes.
